PIA PET ADOPTION
===================
The **main idea** is to make a program that helps in the adoption process showing information that helps in making decisions when adopting a dog.

The program Will do the next tasks:
-----------------------------------
**Dog breeds and names:** You can see the breeds of dogs that are available to adopt, through a list that includes the name of the dog follow by its breed.

**Pet description and care:** You can see the description of each animal which helps to have a much more medical information that helps the adoption process and in order to let decide to the family if the dog can have all the needs covered. The information is going to be name, breed, age, sex, weight and if there is a special care.

**Register a dog:** To add a new dog to the list we need to include its breed, if is female or male, approximate age (human age), weight (kg) and if any special care is needed like is there present a disease, what drugs needs to consume, kind of dog’s food, portions, etc. You must also write a name for the future member of a family to complete the register.

**Adopt a dog:** When someone wants to adopt a dog, when you want to check out, the program will ask you if you are sure and can take the responsibility of take care of the selected dog and to finish the process you will be asked for the name of the dog to give a message to say goodbye. 

When the program is run, a menu of actions will be displayed that will look like this:
